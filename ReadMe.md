Effortlessly reserve meals, drinks, and desserts at the STI Canteen!  

## 📝 Project Overview  
The **STI Canteen** faces challenges in efficiently serving meals to a large number of students and teachers. Long queues during break periods result in wasted time, missed meals, and compromised safety protocols. To address this, we created **Orderscape**, a user-friendly application designed to:  
- Reduce waiting times.  
- Allow users to browse the canteen's menu in advance.  
- Streamline the ordering process for students, teachers, and staff.  
- Assist the canteen staff in managing orders more efficiently.  

**Orderscape** ensures timely meals while maintaining health and safety regulations, making school life more productive and enjoyable.
